Description:
    This package is a modification of HDoutliers package. HDoutliers is a powerful algorithm for the 
    detection of anomalous observations in a dataset, which has (among other advantages) the ability 
    to detect clusters of outliers in multi-dimensional data without requiring a model of the typical
    behavior of the system. However, it suffers from some limitations that affect its accuracy. In
    this package, we propose solutions to  the limitations of HDoutliers, and propose an extension 
    of the algorithm to deal with data streams that exhibit non-stationary behavior. The results show 
    that our proposed algorithm improves the accuracy, and enables the trade-off between false 
    positives and negatives to be better balanced.
